</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>ification is a mod to bring some of the elements of Icewind Dale into the Baldur's Gate series of games. A lot of this project is based upon the work of the <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showforum=155"><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></a> conversion project. </p>
  <p>The mod is currently an open beta so expect some bugs here and there. Please report them on the <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showforum=185">forums</a> so that they can be addressed. </p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>ification  works on all <acronym title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> games that use the Baldur's Gate II engine, which includes the original Baldur's Gate II (Shadows of Amn with or without  Throne of Bhaal), the two major Baldur's Gate conversion mods (Tutu and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>), and the Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition. Content will be adjusted as appropriate for the detected platform--e.g. no +5 items or ninth level spells will be added to a Tutu or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym> game. The Throne of Bhaal expansion is not required. </p>
  <p><a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/tobex">TobEx</a> is highly recommended for players using the spell packs. Without TobEx, spell selection screens during character creation are limited to 24 spells, as are spellbook pages. Since there are more than 24 spells available at some levels you will not be able to see all spells available or be able to select them. Cat's Grace, a second-level arcane spell, relies on functionality provided by TobEx and will be skipped if it's not detected. </p>
  <p>The fourth-level divine spell Giant Insect relies on <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/infinityanimations">Infinity Animations</a>, as the beetles summoned by the spell do not have animations in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, and will be skipped without the mod being installed. One of the summons (yeti) for the sixth-level arcane spell Monster Summoning IV will not be available without Infinity Animations, though the spell will otherwise work with the other two summon options. </p>
</div>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Two-handed axes use the same combat and paperdoll animations as halberds.  </p>
  <p>Contact Other Plane has no dialogue written, so summoning the spirit is fairly pointless at present. </p>
  <p>The Cat's Grace spell (part of the Arcane Spell Pack) requires <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/tobex">TobEx</a> for its unique dexterity modifications. Giant Insect (part of the Divine Spell Pack) requires the beetle animation, part of <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/infinityanimations">Infinity Animations</a>. In addition, Monster Summoning IV (Arcane Spell Pack) will have yetis as a summoning option if the yeti animation and Infinity Animations is installed; otherwise the spell will still work with the other summoning options. </p>
  <p>Just like <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, a small number of spells cannot currently be converted at all. The   current list is: Seven Eyes, Soul Eater, (Great) Shout, Mordenkainen's   Force Missiles, Spiritual Wrath, Mold Touch, Wall of Moonlight, and   Smashing Wave. A few other spells are converted a bit suboptimally, and don't work   quite the way they did in <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>. The current list is Blood Rage, Animal Rage, Static   Charge, and Whirlwind.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>ification is packaged
    and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
    is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have an iwdification folder and setup-iwdification.exe
    in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install,
    simply double-click setup-iwdification.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-iwdification.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder
    to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version.</em> <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>ification is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    If properly extracted, you should have an iwdification folder, setup-iwdification,
    and setup-iwdification.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-iwdification.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Download the latest version of <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> for
    Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg">weidu.org</a> and extract
    (at least) the <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>,
    weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G. /usr/bin). Following that, open a terminal, cd to your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> installation directory, run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries.</p>
  <p> You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini)
    if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the
    archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option
    (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since
    the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both
    options is the safe bet.</p>
  <p> After that, run 'weinstall iwdification from your game installation directory
    to install or uninstall the mod. </p>
</div>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>ification has several
    components, which can be installed completely independently of one another. </p>
  <h3>Icewind Dale Casting Graphics (Andyr) </h3>
  <p><em>Also available in the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks mod </em></p>
  <p> When your character casts a spell, you get a pretty sequence of colors swirling
    around their hand depending on the school the spell cast came from. A necromantic
    spell, for example, looks quite different from creating an illusion. The
    Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games use different sets of animations for
    the schools. This component changes the spellcasting animations to those
    of Icewind Dale. Note that this is purely a cosmetic change--the spells
    themselves function exactly as before. Screenshots for comparison are available
    in the <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?app=gallery&amp;album=27">Tweaks
    gallery</a>. </p>
  <h3>Commoners Use Drab Colors</h3>
  <p><em>Also available in the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks mod </em></p>
  <p> Unlike Icewind Dale, commoners in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> wear
    brightly colored clothes. This tweak changes the random selections of colors
    for commoners to a drab palette. The dress of noblemen and noblewomen are
    not affected. </p>
  <h3>Arcane Spell Pack</h3>
  <p> This component adds about 30 arcane spells from Icewind Dale. This component does not alter existing <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> spells to match their <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> counterparts, with one exception: <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>'s standalone Emotion spell becomes <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>'s Emotion: Hopelessness so that the full series of Emotion spells can be made available. </p>
  <p class="spell_description">Decastave<br />
    (Evocation)<br />
    Level: 2<br />
    Range: Caster <br />
    Duration: 1 round/level <br />
    Casting Time: 2<br />
    Area of Effect: Caster<br />
    Saving Throw: None<br />
    This spell creates a staff of force in the caster's hand. It is treated as a magical weapon, doing 1-6 hit points of damage per hit, and it can hit creatures immune to normal weapons. It is a staff, however, so if the caster does not have a proficiency in staff weapons, then the Decastave is used at a penalty. The staff also has the power to drain a target of 1-2 hit points on the first strike. These hit points are added to the caster's, but they can only heal damage the caster has taken; they will not raise his hit points beyond his normal maximum.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Cat's Grace (Alteration)<br />
    Level: 2<br />
    Range: Touch <br />
    Duration: 1 hour/level <br />
    Casting Time: 2<br />
    Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
    Saving Throw: None <br />
    This spell magically increases a target's dexterity.  The amount depends on the target's class:  Thieves gain <acronym title="1 roll of an 8-sided die">1d8</acronym> points, Fighters and Mages gain <acronym title="1 roll of a 6-sided die">1d6</acronym> points, and Clerics gain <acronym title="1 roll of a 4-sided die">1d4</acronym> points.  Cat's Grace cannot raise a target's dexterity past 20.</p>
  <p>Cat's Grace requires TobEx to be installed, otherwise it will be skipped.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Snilloc's Snowball Swarm<br />
    (Evocation)<br />
    Level: 2<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster <br />
    Duration: Instantaneous<br />
    Casting Time: 2<br />
    Area of Effect: 25-foot radius<br />
    Saving Throw: 1/2 damage<br />
    This spell causes a flurry of snowballs to erupt from a point within range. These snowballs will hit everything within the area of effect, doing 1-3 hit points/level, up to a maximum of 8-24 hit points at level 8. Against fire-using or fire-dwelling creatures, it inflicts 1-6 hit points/level.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Icelance (Evocation)<br />
    Level: 3<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster<br />
    Duration: Instantaneous <br />
    Casting Time: 3<br />
    Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
    Saving Throw: Special<br />
    This spell fires a magical lance of ice at a target of the caster's choosing.  It automatically hits, inflicting 5-30 points of damage and forcing the target to make a saving throw vs. spell or be stunned for 1-4 rounds.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Lance of Disruption (Invocation)<br />
    Level: 3<br />
    Range: 60 feet<br />
    Duration: Instantaneous<br />
    Casting Time: 3<br />
    Area of Effect: Special<br />
    Saving Throw: 1/2<br />
    This spell creates a lance of force, extending from the caster to a specified point 60 feet in the distance.  Any creatures in the lance's path take <acronym title="5 rolls of a 4-sided die">5d4</acronym> points of bludgeoning damage, +2 points of damage per level of the caster (maximum of +30).  Victims can save vs. spell for half damage.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Beltyn's Burning Blood<br />
    (Necromancy)<br />
    Level: 4<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster<br />
    Duration: 1 round/2 levels<br />
    Casting Time: 4<br />
    Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
    Saving Throw: Neg.<br />
    This spell turns a target's blood to flame, doing 3-12 hit points of damage every round and driving the victim berserk with pain. The target gets to save vs. spell every round; if successful, the damage and berserk state are negated.  This spell does not work against undead or extraplanar creatures that do not have blood (such as elementals). If the creature is resistant to fire, this resistance will lower or nullify the damage from this spell.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Emotion: Hopelessness<br />
    (Enchantment/Charm)<br />
    Level: 4<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster<br />
    Duration: 1 turn<br />
    Casting Time: 4<br />
    Area of Effect: 10-foot radius<br />
    Saving Throw: Neg.<br />
    This spell creates the emotion of hopelessness within the area of effect. All creatures affected by the spell just stand and do nothing for the duration of the spell.</p>
  <p>Emotion: Hopelessness will replace the existing Emotion spell in Baldur's Gate II.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Emotion: Courage<br />
    (Enchantment/Charm)<br />
    Level: 4<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster<br />
    Duration: 5 turns<br />
    Casting Time: 4<br />
    Area of Effect: 10-foot radius<br />
    Saving Throw: Neg.<br />
    This spell creates the emotion of courage within the area of effect. All creatures affected by the spell gain +1 to hit, +3 to their damage rolls, and +5 temporary hit points (which can put them above their maximum hit points). This spell nullifies all fear effects within the area of effect at the time of casting.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Emotion: Fear<br />
    (Enchantment/Charm)<br />
    Level: 4<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster<br />
    Duration: 5 rounds<br />
    Casting Time: 4<br />
    Area of Effect: 10-foot radius<br />
    Saving Throw: Neg.<br />
    This spell creates the emotion of fear within the area of effect. All creatures affected by the spell flee for 5 rounds.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Emotion: Hope<br />
    (Enchantment/Charm)<br />
    Level: 4<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster<br />
    Duration: 5 turns<br />
    Casting Time: 4<br />
    Area of Effect: 10-foot radius<br />
    Saving Throw: Neg.<br />
    This spell creates the emotion of hope within the area of effect. All creatures affected by the spell gain a morale boost, and +2 on their saving throws, attack rolls and damage rolls. </p>
  <p class="spell_description">Vitriolic Sphere (Conjuration)<br />
    Level: 4<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster<br />
    Duration: Special<br />
    Casting Time: 4<br />
    Area of Effect: Special<br />
    Saving Throw: Special<br />
    This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range.  When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid.  The victim suffers <acronym title="1 roll of a 4-sided die">1d4</acronym> points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of <acronym title="12 rolls of a 4-sided die">12d4</acronym> points of damage.  After the initial damage, the victim must make a saving throw to avoid more damage.  If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round.  For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts <acronym title="8 rolls of a 4-sided die">8d4</acronym> damage with this spell on the first round, <acronym title="6 rolls of a 4-sided die">6d4</acronym> on the second round, <acronym title="4 rolls of a 4-sided die">4d4</acronym> on the third round, <acronym title="2 rolls of a 4-sided die">2d4</acronym> on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round.  Each round the victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to avoid further damage.  The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-foot radius around the primary target.  Any creatures within the splash radius must save vs. polymorph/paralyzation or suffer a splash hit that inflicts <acronym title="1 roll of a 4-sided die">1d4</acronym> points of damage per every five levels of the caster.  Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Shadow Monsters<br />
    (Illusion/Phantasm)<br />
    Level: 4<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster <br />
    Duration: 1 round/level<br />
    Casting Time: 4<br />
    Area of Effect: 20-foot cube<br />
    Saving Throw: Special<br />
    This spell shapes material from the Demiplane of Shadow into illusionary monsters. These monsters are randomly summoned one by one with Hit Dice between 1 and the level of the spellcaster, until the summoned creatures' Hit Dice total the spellcaster's level. (For example, a 15th level wizard could summon a 10th level creature one round, then the next round the next creature appearing would have 1 through 5 Hit Dice, and so on.) These shadowy creatures have only 20% of the hit points of their real-world counterparts, although their attacks do full damage.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Shroud of Flame (Invocation)<br />
    Level: 5<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster <br />
    Duration: 1 round/2 levels (special)<br />
    Casting Time: 5<br />
    Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
    Saving Throw: Neg.<br />
    This spell causes a creature to burst into flames if it fails a saving throw vs. spell. The creature will burn for <acronym title="2 rolls of a 6-sided die">2d6</acronym> points of damage every round, and gouts of flame erupt from the burning target, causing any creatures within ten feet of the target to take <acronym title="1 roll of a 4-sided die">1d4</acronym> points of damage from the flames.  Anyone hit by the victim's flames must also make a saving throw vs. spell to avoid contracting the shroud themselves.  The shroud of flame dissipates if the caster and target are no longer in the same area.  This spell is particularly useful in dispersing packs of trolls and frost salamanders.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Demi-Shadow Monsters<br />
    (Illusion/Phantasm)<br />
    Level: 5<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster<br />
    Duration: 1 round/level<br />
    Casting Time: 5<br />
    Area of Effect: 20-foot cube<br />
    Saving Throw: None<br />
    This spell is similar to the 4th level wizard spell, Shadow Monsters, except the summoned creatures are much more powerful, with 40% of the hit points of their real-world counterpart.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Summon Shadow<br />
    (Conjuration/Summoning, Necromancy)<br />
    Level: 5<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster<br />
    Duration: 1 round + 1 round/level <br />
    Casting Time: 5<br />
    Area of Effect: 10-foot cube<br />
    Saving Throw: None<br />
    This spell summons one shadow for every three levels of the caster. This shadow will obey the orders of the caster, attacking his enemies or performing tasks until the spell expires or the shadows are slain.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Contact Other Plane (Divination)<br />
    Level: 5<br />
    Range: Caster<br />
    Duration: Instantaneous<br />
    Casting Time: 1 round<br />
    Area of Effect: Caster<br />
    Saving Throw: None<br />
    This spell allows the wizard to contact powers from other planes of existence in order to receive advice and information.  The nature of the divination is oriented around knowledge of powerful foes, magic items, and spells.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Lich Touch<br />
    (Necromancy)<br />
    Level: 6<br />
    Range: Touch <br />
    Duration: 1 round/level <br />
    Casting Time: 6<br />
    Area of Effect: Caster<br />
    Saving Throw: Special<br />
    This spell confers the powers of a lich's touch and a lich's immunities upon the caster. The wizard gains immunity to paralysis and fear while the spell is in effect, and his hands glow with an unearthly green radiance that does 1-10 hit points of damage to a target and paralyzes them unless a saving throw vs. paralyzation is made. This spell has no effect on undead.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Antimagic Shell<br />
    (Abjuration)<br />
    Level: 6<br />
    Range: Caster <br />
    Duration: 1 turn/level<br />
    Casting Time: 1<br />
    Area of Effect: Caster<br />
    Saving Throw: None<br />
    This spell surrounds the caster with an invisible barrier that moves with him. This barrier makes the wizard immune to any magical attacks, but it prevents the wizard from casting spells out of the shell.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Monster Summoning IV<br />
    (Conjuration/Summoning) <br />
    Level: 6<br />
    Range: 40 yards <br />
    Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level<br />
    Casting Time: 6<br />
    Area of Effect: Special <br />
    Saving Throw: None <br />
    With the casting of this spell the wizard summons 1-3 4th level monsters.  These appear within spell range and may be commanded to attack the caster's opponents until the spell duration expires or the monsters are slain.</p>
  <p>Yeti will be available for Monster Summoning IV if the animation has been added by Infinity Animations.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Otiluke's Freezing Sphere<br />
    (Alteration, Evocation)<br />
    Level: 6<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster <br />
    Duration: Instantaneous<br />
    Casting Time: 6<br />
    Area of Effect: 1 creature<br />
    Saving Throw: Neg.<br />
    This spell fires an orb of cold at a creature that inflicts 3-6 points of cold damage/level of the caster. If the target makes its saving throw, however, they have dodged the orb and avoided all damage.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Shades (Illusion/Phantasm)<br />
    Level: 6<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster <br />
    Duration: 1 round/level <br />
    Casting Time: 6<br />
    Area of Effect: 20-foot cube<br />
    Saving Throw: None<br />
    Shades is similar to Shadow Monsters and Demishadow Monsters - it allows the caster to shape material from the Demiplane of Shadow into illusionary creatures. These shadows are tougher than the shadows summoned by Shadow Monsters and Demishadow Monsters, and they will obey the caster until the spell expires or they are slain.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Darts of Bone (Necromancy)<br />
    Level: 6<br />
    Range: Caster<br />
    Duration: 5 rounds<br />
    Casting Time: 5<br />
    Area of Effect: Caster<br />
    Saving Throw: None<br />
    This spell creates nine darts that can be used by the caster and cannot be unequipped so long as the spell is in effect.  The darts are +3, do <acronym title="1 roll of a 4-sided die">1d4</acronym> damage, and a creature struck by a dart must save vs. death or take another <acronym title="2 rolls of a 6-sided die">2d6</acronym> damage and have its strength reduced by 3 for 5 rounds.  The caster's weapon proficiency with darts (or lack thereof) has no effect on the darts' chances to hit a target.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Trollish Fortitude (Necromancy)<br />
    Level: 6<br />
    Range: Caster<br />
    Duration: 2 turns<br />
    Casting Time: 6<br />
    Area of Effect: Caster<br />
    Saving Throw: None<br />
    This spell imbues the caster with the resilience of a troll, allowing the caster to regenerate 5 hit points per round up to his/her maximum hit points.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Monster Summoning V<br />
    (Conjuration/Summoning) <br />
    Level: 7<br />
    Range: 40 yards <br />
    Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/level<br />
    Casting Time: 6<br />
    Area of Effect: Special <br />
    Saving Throw: None <br />
    With the casting of this spell the wizard summons 1-3 5th level monsters.  These appear within spell range and may be commanded to attack the caster's opponents until the spell duration expires or the monsters are slain.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Malavon's Rage<br />
    (Evocation)<br />
    Level: 7<br />
    Range: Caster<br />
    Duration: Instantaneous<br />
    Casting Time: 1<br />
    Area of Effect: 15-foot radius<br />
    Saving Throw: 1/2<br />
    Malavon's Rage was created by the dark elf sorcerer Malavon.  It shoots darts of pure energy out from the caster's body in all directions, harming friend and foe alike.  The small wedges of magic do 20-80 points of piercing damage to everything caught in their path.  This spell is especially useful when a mage is surrounded by enemies.</p>
  <p class="spell_description">Acid Storm<br />
    (Evocation)<br />
    Level: 7<br />
    Range: Sight of Caster<br />
    Duration: 1 round/level<br />
    Casting Time: 7<br />
    Area of Effect: 20-foot radius<br />
    Saving Throw: 1/2<br />
    This spell unleashes an acidic downpour on the area of effect, doing 1-4 hit points of damage each round for the first three rounds, 1-6 hit points for the next three rounds, and 1-8 hit points for each round thereafter. Moving out of the area of effect does not stop the damage - the acid adheres to the skin, and any creatures in the area of effect when the Acid Storm is cast continue to suffer damage as long as the spell duration lasts. Creatures make a saving throw vs. spell every round after they have been hit by the cloud - if successful, they only take half-damage (for that round only).</p>

    Area of Effect: 10-foot radius<br />

    This spell draws the breath out of all creatures within the area of effect. Creatures that do not breathe are unaffected. Suffocating creatures suffer -4 to armor class, -4 to hit, -6 to dexterity, one less attack per round, half movement rate, and take 4d8 points of damage per round. A successful saving throw negates all effects but <acronym title="2 rolls of an 8-sided die">2d8</acronym> points of damage for one round. The effects begin to fade when the creature moves out of the area of effect, although it may take a round for a character to catch their second wind.</p>

    Duration: 2 turns<br />
    Casting Time: 8<br />
    Area of Effect: Caster<br />
    Saving Throw: None<br />
    This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, granting him several powerful resistances and abilities.  While the spell is in effect, the caster is 100% resistant to electricity, 50% resistant to fire, and 25% resistant to crushing damage.  Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster are ignored.  In addition, the caster's strength is raised to 25, and the caster can attack twice per round with iron fists for <acronym title="2 rolls of a 4-sided die">2d4</acronym> points of damage + appropriate strength bonuses.  Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward, setting his movement rate to 25% of his normal, and he/she cannot cast spells while Iron Body is in effect.</p>

    When the Curse spell is uttered, the caster lowers the morale of enemy creatures and penalizes their saving throws and attack rolls by -1.

    Saving Throw: 1/2<br />
    This spell creates a silver-hued, partially ethereal lance shaped in the form of an alicorn (a unicorn horn).

      Area of Effect: Caster<br />
      Saving Throw: None<br />
      This spell summons forth a silent, weightless sword-like construct made of moonlight that extends 4 feet from the caster's hand.  The moonblade is considered a +4 weapon for determining what creatures it can damage, though the bonus does not apply to <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym>.  In addition, due to the insubstantial nature of the moonblade, melee bonuses from strength do not apply.</p>
    <p>The strike of a moonblade drains a target's vitality, inflicting <acronym title="1 roll of a 12-sided die">1d12</acronym>+4 points of damage, and an additional <acronym title="1 roll of a 12-sided die">1d12</acronym> points to undead, who are particularly susceptible.

  <h3>Bard Song</h3>
  <p>Bards in Icewind Dale gained different bard songs as they leveled:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Ballad of Three Heroes - Available at level one, this provides all allies with +1 to hit, +1 damage, and +1 to saving throws.</li>
    <li>The Tale of Curran Strongheart - Available at level three, this song protects the party from fear and removes any current fear effects.</li>
    <li>Tymora's Melody - Available at level five, the party gains +1 luck, +3 to all saves, and +10 to lore and thieving skills.</li>
    <li>The Song of Kaudies - Available at level seven, this provides a 50% resistance to sound-based attacks and spells such as power words, sirine charm, silence, and others.</li>
    <li>The Siren's Yearning - Available at level nine, this song enthralls your foes, preventing action for five rounds on a failed save vs. spell.</li>
    <li>War Chant of the Sith - Available at level 11, this provides +2 <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>, regeneration of two <acronym title="Hit Points">HP</acronym>/round, and 10% resistance to all crushing, missile, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As the songs become available to the bard, the ability to freely switch between them is available. This component only affects trueclass bards, as the available kits use variants of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> bard song for kit advantages and/or disadvantages.</p>
  <h3>Two Handed Axes</h3>
  <p>Icewind Dale also featured two-handed axes, as opposed to the strictly one-handed variety found in the Baldur's Gate series. This component scatters normal and magical two-handed axes throughout the game to make them available for players. Two-handed axes use the axe proficiency and have base stats of 9 speed and <acronym title="1 roll of a 10-sided die">1d10</acronym> damage.</p>
